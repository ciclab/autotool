/* ECOFF has COFF sections, but the debugging information is stored in
   a completely different format.  ECOFF targets use some of the
   swapping routines from coffswap.h, and some of the generic COFF
   routines in coffgen.c, but, unlike the real COFF targets, do not
   use coffcode.h itself.

   Get the generic COFF swapping routines, except for the reloc,
   symbol, and lineno ones.  Give them ECOFF names.  */
